The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its ravaging side effects. One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. ", "William West", " of ", "Biotherapeutics Inc", " of ", "Franklin", ", ", "Tenn", "., is particularly significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after it changed the way in which the drug is administered.
