may in good faith estimate that sum or obligation and set off in respect of that estimate, subject to X or Y, as the case may be,
accounting to the other party when such sum or obligation is ascertained.

Nothing in this provision shall be effective or deemed to create any charge or other security interest.

Deferral Period for Unscheduled Holiday: In the event the Scheduled Valuation Date becomes subject to the Following Business
Day Convention and if the Valuation Date has not occurred on or before the 30th
consecutive day after the Scheduled Valuation Date (any such period being a Deferral
Period), then the next day after the Referral Period that would have been a Business
Day but for the unscheduled Holiday shall be deemed to be the Valuation Date.

Valuation Postponement for Price Source Valuation Postponement means, for purposes of obtaining a Settlement Rate, that the

Disruption: Spot Rate will be determined on the Business Day first succeeding the day on which the
Price Source Disruption ceases to exist, unless the Price Source Disruption continues to
exist (measured from the date that, but for the occurrence of the Price Source Disruption,
would have been the Valuation Date) for a consecutive number of calendar days equal to
the Maximum Days of Postponement. In such event, the Spot Rate will be determined
on the next Business Day after the Maximum Days of Postponement in accordance with

consecutive calendar days during which either (i) valuation is deferred due to an

of (i) and (11), exceed 30 consecutive calendar days in the aggregate. Accordingly, (x) if,
upon the lapse of any such 30 day period, an Unscheduled Holiday shall have occurred
or be continuing on the day following such period, then such day shall be deemed to be a
Valuation Date, and (y) if, upon the lapse of any such day period, a Price Source
Disruption shall have occurred or be continuing on the day following such period. then
Valuation Postponement shall not apply and the Spot Rate shall be determined in
accordance with the next Disruption Fallback.

Adjustment to Payment Date(s): Each Payment Date and Exchange Date for the Transaction shall be as specified above,
provided however, that if the corresponding Scheduled Valuation Date is adjusted in
accordance with the Following Business Day Convention, or if Valuation Postponement
applies, in each such case the Payment Date or the Exchange Date, as the case may be,
shall be as soon as practicable, but in no event later than two Business Days after the
date on which the Spot Rate is determined. Further, if payments are scheduled to be
made by both parties on a Payment Date or Exchange Date, and such date is adjusted
due to the occurrence of an Unscheduled Holiday or Valuation Postponement in
accordance with the previous sentence, then such Payment
